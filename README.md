## Team Members
* Yuqi Jin

* Sai Yasasvi Dutt Malladi (Yash)
## Dataset
* dialogs.txt which consists of questions and answers, which involve opinions, preferences, and personal experiences 
* The way of creating our own dataset is to write our own examples and responses for 20 lines, then we use AI tool to generate the rest thousands lines

* The train_data.csv which has been tockenized the dialogs.txt by adding <eos> and <sos> for each sequence. 
## Approach
Implement the following models to accomplish the interaction of chatbot
* Seq2Seq model (keras_seq2seq_model.ipynb)
* Transformer model (Transformer_model.ipynb)

## Installation Instructions
Highly recommend run on Google Colab
If run on vscode or other platforms
* git clone (Clone the repository to your local machine)
* cd repository
*
